# What Does Biden’s Tax Plan Mean For You?

“President-elect Joe Biden would enact a number of policies that would raise taxes on individuals with income above $400,000, including raising individual income, capital gains, and payroll taxes. Biden would also raise taxes on corporations.” – The Tax Foundation

Here’s what the Left is saying:

“The vast majority of Americans are unlikely to see their taxes go up under President-elect Joe Biden. Only the wealthy and corporations would see their tax bills go up. Middle-income households could see an average tax cut of $680. [The] plans are likely to be dead on arrival if Republicans win at least one of two runoff races in Georgia.”
– CNN

“Overall, the Biden plan is “very progressive” even though taxes would climb on all income groups on average. The top 20 percent would bear almost 93 percent of the tax increases. No quintile in the bottom 80 percent would see an average tax increase of more than 0.5 percent.” – Politico

“Joe Biden wants to see higher taxes on the rich, especially those who derive most of their income from stock ownership and other investments. The former Vice President’s overall vision for increasing social spending in the United States is ambitious. His tax ideas, meanwhile, are less dramatic than the new wealth tax proposal Warren made famous.” – Vox

Here’s what the Right is saying:

“A new study shows that Joe Biden’s proposed economic plan would significantly hurt the long-term American economy if implemented. While many mainstream media outlets claim Biden’s plan will target the wealthy and save the middle-class money, the 50-page study released by the Hoover Institution shows different results. The economists warn that, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s projections, 2030 may yield “4.9 million fewer employed individuals, $2.6 trillion less GDP, and $1.5 trillion less consumption in that year alone. The economists also note that the median household income in 2030 would fall by $6,500.” – The Federalist

“Biden’s tax plans have come under scrutiny over intentions to raise rates for wealthy Americans but some experts say they could also contribute to an exodus from high-tax states. State and local governments are dealing with massive Coronavirus related budget deficits, which means they are in need of additional revenue. As many as 23 million households said they planned to relocate to another city or region because of the pandemic.” – Fox Business
