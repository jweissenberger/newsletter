#Courts Find No Evidence of Voter Fraud in Presidential Election

“President Donald Trump’s campaign filed a number of lawsuits across six battleground states this month as he tried to upend the 2020 election. Judges uniformly rejected his claims of voter fraud. The latest case ended Saturday, Nov. 21, when a federal judge in Pennsylvania said Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani presented only ‘speculative accusations’ that brought to mind ‘Frankenstein’s monster’.” – The Associated Press

“A federal judge dealt a death blow to the Trump campaign’s effort to overturn Joe Biden’s win of the presidency. [The judge] rejected the Trump campaign’s attempt to throw out the Pennsylvania vote. The Trump campaign on Saturday night said they would appeal [the judge]’s ruling, and quickly, with the intention of taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court”

“Harvard law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz said President Trump has a number of legal theories he can pursue in his efforts to swing the 2020 election result in his favor. Dershowitz said there are several avenues that Trump could take, but that even those options currently appear limited in their ability to secure an election victory.”

Vox (Left):
“[The judge] mocked the [Trump] campaign for its inability to present a coherent argument. The judge held multiple leadership positions within the republican party.”

The Blaze (Right):
“Trump’s campaign said they welcomed Brann’s decision because it expedites their plan to go to the Supreme Court. The judge dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning Trump cannot file another lawsuit on the same grounds.”
