# Affirmative Action: What do the Left and Right think?

After a ruling in favor of Harvard in a federal appeals court, the issue of affirmative action has come back in the spotlight. A historically contentious set of policies, there are competing opinions on the topic. To further complicate things, the state of California voted to uphold the states ban on the practice:

The left says:

That the ruling is harmful:

“This has had long-term ramifications, according to a recent UC Berkeley study. Since underrepresented minorities ended up attending lower-quality public and private universities, they experienced an overall decline in wages of 5 percent annually between ages 24 and 34. Overall, the study found that the ban on affirmative action has exacerbated socioeconomic inequities.”

Fabiola Cineas, Vox
That the results of the California vote are shameful:

“What a shame, and what a missed opportunity. The ban set back the state’s efforts to promote diversity. The debate over Proposition 16 focused on the University of California. But the student acceptance rate still doesn’t adequately represent the state’s diversity. But that ignores the institutional racism baked into our society that disadvantages people of color. Our institutions continue to be hobbled by this unnecessary prohibition.”

Editorial Board, LA Times
Some cite that the recent economic downturn could be the cause of this increased antipathy towards affirmative action:

“In a nation where many still deny the impacts of systemic racism and economic inequality, it’s always going to be hard to persuade a majority to make even a small sacrifice to address those issues. That likely goes double during a record-setting economic downturn: Hard times rarely inspire generosity but instead a determined insistence on looking out for No. 1. The stereotype of the progressive Californian can’t compensate for that.”

Helaine Owen, Washington Post
And regarding the Harvard ruling, that there was still more work to be done:


Regarding the Harvard case, “in its 104-page ruling, the two-judge panel said SFFA hadn’t presented a single Asian-American applicant who claimed Harvard discriminated against them. To the contrary, the court pointed out that several former and current students — including some Asian-American students — testified in favor of race-conscious admissions at the trial… Still, the legal battle, which comes amid a fraught national reckoning on race, is far from over.”

The right says:

That the results of the California vote are a victory for equality:

“People are better off without it. Since California often sets the trend for the rest of America, hopefully the defeat of Prop 16 will inspire other parts of the country to follow suit. Maybe the time has come for us to finally end race-based preference in all college admissions and public employment so we can fulfill the ideal that every American will have an equal opportunity to live to their full potential, regardless of their race, ethnicity, and gender.”

Helen Raleigh, The Federalist
They condemn the Left’s resentment of the will of American voters:

Voters in the rest of the state were not buying it. Predictably, elites are charging those voters with racism. A writer for the FiveThirtyEight blog, Matt Grossman, calls the defeat of Proposition 16 a “sign of the limits to Americans’ liberalizing attitudes on racial discrimination.” This idea—that to oppose racial discrimination is in fact to favor racial discrimination—has always been the cheekiest claim on the part of the identitarian Left… Americans still understand that the best way to fulfill the promise of this nation is to treat one another as individuals, not as fungible members of warring tribes.

Heather Mac Donald, City Journal
And underscore that the results of the Prop. 16 truly is their will:

“In pre-election polling, whites, Latinos, and Asians indicated that they were likely to vote against it. As it turns out, most Americans want to live in a country where people are not judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character, and their accomplishments. I would wager that most Americans do not want to live in the anti-American fantasy world of The New York Times, whose 1619 Project proclaims that the United States was conceived in iniquity, and dedicated to the proposition that the black man must be kept down at all times.”

Rod Dreher, The American Conservative
And hope the issue advances to the SCOTUS:

We hope they take the case… The U.S. is far more ethnically diverse than it once was, with many more groups qualifying as minorities… A Pew Research survey in 2019 found that a majority of Americans overwhelmingly reject considering race in college admissions. Time for the Supreme Court to meet the moment.
