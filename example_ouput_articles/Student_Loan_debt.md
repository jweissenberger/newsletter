# Studen Loan Debt

As a consensus on the 2020 Presidential election is slowly reached, voters are returning to the issues that helped earn Biden the Oval – student loan forgiveness being one of them.

So what’s the temperature on both sides of the aisle?

Here’s what the Right has to say:

Debt forgiveness is a slippery fiscal slope and could set a poor precedent for the Presidential purse:

Forgiving student loans with such a broad stroke would create tremendous moral hazard. Individuals who scrimped for years, forgoing dinners with friends and vacations and fancy phones to pay off their student loans, would effectively feel ripped off knowing that had they only been more profligate, the federal government would have wiped away all of their debt. Those who were much less careful about their spending patterns, on the other hand, would feel vindicated.

If a president could wipe away debt with a stroke of a pen, Biden would not be the last president to do so. Those taking out debt in the future would be sent the signal that if they simply hold out long enough, they can avoid repaying the money.

Echoing these feelings, the Right feels that those who chose not to attend college, or to pay their own way, would be left out:

Clearly, carte blanche student debt forgiveness is pretty regressive. He has recommended canceling student debt only for undergraduate degrees and for students making less than $125,000. In the case of any of these student debt plans, working class Americans who chose not to or could not afford to go to college will be subsidizing the education of the professional class.

Amber Athey, The Spectator
Adding to the consensus, critics of debt forgiveness see it as self-serving:

The popularity of this idea stems from the fact that the Democratic Party has increasingly become the party of educated professionals, as the GOP has become more working-class. Lots of poor people are still Democrats, but they aren’t a major source of power within the party — the bureaucrats claiming to speak for them are. And that’s who Democrats are prioritizing.

Here’s what the Left has to say:

Some say loans are harmful, and the problem can be solved easily via executive order…

“Student loans are delaying retirements. They’re suppressing the housing market. In one survey, more than half of borrowers said that they have experienced depression because of their debt. It did not have to be this way, nor does it have to be this way. Most student loan borrowers are college graduates, and thus winners in this winner-take-all economy.”

Annie Lowrey, The Atlantic
While others see this as short-sighted…

“Forgiving debt without addressing the root causes of the student loan crisis is also, obviously, not ideal, since the next generation of students will still have to borrow for school, and eventually the country will end up right back where it started. It’s a bit like getting liposuction before returning to a diet of Triple Whoppers and guilt—a quick fix destined for relapse.”

Jordan Weissman, Slate
And others still take the idea further, student loan forgiveness and tuition cancellation:

“We need to cancel every penny of current debt and eliminate tuition so no one ever has to take out another loan again.

It might not be politically possible to carry out all aspects of this program in the next few years. If the GOP controls the Senate, Joe Biden will have an ironclad excuse not to try to eliminate tuition across the board — or even to try to carry out his campaign promise to eliminate it for students at two-year colleges. But none of that adds up to a reason not to carry out the part of this agenda that Biden himself admits can be handled by executive order.

If he cancels the first $10,000, he’ll have forfeited his excuse for leaving the rest in place. He needs to cancel it all.”
